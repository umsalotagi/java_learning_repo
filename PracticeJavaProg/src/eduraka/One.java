//	 compile time error: creating class file from .java file is compiling. converting programme to machine code (Byte code), JVM understand it on any os.
//	 compile time error occurs when IDE starts to create class file from .java file and it does this regularly (syntax error, Exception is not reachable, statement is not reachable etc.)
//	 checks are done in compile and run time also
//	 pointer is not exposed. so secured
//	 Garbage collection : when memory is not utilized, java handles it
//	 All object are evaluated at runtime, so polymorphism
//	 distributed : run programme in different machine. programme can call method from another programme on another machine

//	 java has 3 flavours
//	 j2se : standard edition
//	 j2ee : enterprise edition
//	 j2me : micro edition (embedded system)
//	
//	 JRE :   JVM + Set libraries like rt.jar etc. + Other files (does not contain compiler and debugger)
//	 JDK : JRE + Development tools

	 * Access modifiers : public, private, protected

Encapsulation of OOP

Default : within the package
Public : anywhere
Private: visible to class
Protected : visible to package and subclasses 

Superclass, subclass, inheritance 

Non Access Modifiers:
Static : methods and variables. static variables are stored in different memory (not stack or heap but in permanent generation memory)
static : can also be class. specially inner class can also be static, so you does not need to create object of outer class to create object of inner static class
Final : finalizing the implementation of class, method and variables. 
A final method cannot be overridden or hidden by subclasses.[3] 
final class cannot be extended. No class can subclass the final class. 
This is used to prevent unexpected behavior from a subclass altering a method that may be crucial to the function or consistency of the class.[4]
. If a final variable holds a reference to an object, then the state of the object may be changed by operations on the object, but the variable always refer to the same object 
Abstract : classes and methods     , functions that to be implemented by subclasses, class which has abstract is abstract class

Synchronized : one thread can access it at one time (used by threads)
Volatile : don’t store in cache, store in main memory so everyone gets latest value



Variable
Local : within the method, visibility within method
Instance: (have default values, 0 for number, false for bool, null for object reference
class variable (Static) : shared within all objects (class level)

Instance variable is created in part of memory, called heap 

Primitive data types (are not object, predefined by language) keywords
Non - primitive / reference variable : String 

Reference variable : does not hold object itself but holds reference address to the object 

Implicit / explicit conversion

45d - double, 7f- float 
Explicit conversion:


Operator:
i++     assigned and the operated
++i     added and the assigned
>>      shift operator
=, +=, -=, /=

int is primitive data type whereas Integer is class corresponding to int

method signature :: public Integer add (Integer a , Integer b) {
	 */
	
	
	
	
	

}
